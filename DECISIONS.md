# Use dasherization for filenames

## Context and Problem Statement

Graphics files have to take a consistent file name

## Decision Drivers <!-- optional -->

* Easy to process by Jekyll
* No WTFs at the creators

## Considered Options

* [Dasherization](https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/a/104476/52607) (e.g., `architecture-bpmn4tosca.png`)
* Camel Case (e.g., `ArchitectureBPMN4TOSCA.png`)

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "Dasherization", because

* clear separation of parts of the name
* consistent to other URLs (which are typically lowercase)
